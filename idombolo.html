      <p>
        Beef stew is a hearty, warm meal across the world, that leaves you with
        that aaaah feeling! Dombolo is a traditional South African steamed
        bread, this one is easy to make as it uses baking powder.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Beef Stew with dombolo - Minah's beef stew is even more special as
        we celebrate our South African heritage because we ran a competition
        amongst our team to get their family favourites. Minah is a cashier at
        our Middelburg branch
