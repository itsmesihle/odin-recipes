      <h3>Step 7</h3>
      <p>
        Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over
        medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but
        whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 8</h3>
      <p>
        Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture,
        a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each
        serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of
        sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>
        You can use Sriracha sauce instead of gochujang, or substitute with soy
        sauce for those who cannot handle the spiciness.
